Create git local repo:
* git init (make sure you are in the correct directory/working directory)

Staging Area - is an intermediate place where you can pick and choose which files you want to commit

Use "git status" to see what is in the staging area / shows untracked files

git add [filename or .(all files)] --> added to the staging and is ready to be committed

Committing --> git commit -m <"Write message here>
Note: commit messages should be written in the present tense

ls -a --> shows all hidden files in current directory
git log --> shows the logs of changes made 

Commit file(s) to local repository using git commit

					^
					|					

Add file(s) using git add which adds files to the staging area where they prepare for commit

					^
					|

Create file in working directory which is the directory where git was initialized(git init)

File(s) can be rollbacked to last position in local repo by using git checkout [filename]

Check what changes were made in a file by using ==> git diff [filename]

Pushing an existing local repository onto a remote repository (GitHub)

1. Copy address of GitHub repo

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/emmanuelreyes28/Story.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   
   Note: When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. You must create a personal access token through GitHub settings.

Working directory -> Staging Area -> Local Repo(master branch) -> Remote Repo(GitHub)
