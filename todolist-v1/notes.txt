*Creating Templates with EJS*

1. npm i ejs
2. app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
3. create a views folder
4. within views folder create file called list.ejs
5. write html code within list.ejs file
6. use the following as marker to tell the file to replace whatever is inside the
   marker with the value of the variable. marker --> <%= EJS %>
7. res.render("name of ejs file", {marker variable name (key): current variable (value)});

Scriplet tag --> <%
- use for control flow, no output (e.g. if statements and switch statements)

You can give buttons a dynamic "value" to determine which list an item has been added to.
Whether that be the original list or the work list.
Use a conditional statement to determine which list the item belongs to by accessing req.body.[name of button] (specific to this project)
Have the appropriate action take place.

EJS Layout --> <%- include("name of layout") -%>
You can create layouts with EJS which help keep cosistency across different web pages without having to repeat the same html code.
